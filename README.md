# Emotion Detection Web Application

Emotion detection goes beyond sentiment analysis by extracting more nuanced emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, and more from text statements. This capability is essential for AI-based recommendation systems, chatbots, and various other applications. In this project, we will harness the power of Watson AI to create an emotion detection application.
